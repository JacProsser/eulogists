								<p class="leading">The Eulogists is a combined effort between 5 musicians. Many of whom
									run personal YouTube Channels. They wanted to combine forces to make something
									great. The Eulogist Channel was born. We all wanted to be like the big YouTube video
									essay channels. Channels such as Nexpo, Barely Sociable, and blameitonjorge, but
									with a musical twist. They all had this goal. But individually they could not make
									it happen. However, when we made a joint effort, we could be more.</p>
								<p>They all for the most part met on Discord through a technology server. Even though
									they were on a technology server they started talking about their musical interests.
									The idea was born. At first, they wanted to do a podcast discussing music. However,
									that idea morphed into an entire YouTube channel. It was just Calvin, Quinn, and
									Rylan at first. All three from different countries, using Discord to chat. After
									their first 2 video essays, they knew they needed more people. It was then they
									added Fifo.</p>
								<p>Fifo was a wild card in our group. He did many things. Things like help moderate the
									Eulogists discord. They all had their place in the group contributing equally to
									help keep the YouTube channel running smoothly. </p>
								<p>After they had decided to stick to a weekly upload schedule, they knew that they had
									to have weekly filler content to fill the gaps between essays. This is where Tusk
									comes in. Tusk’s expertise is in music mixing mashups and remixes. He helped to
									provide. The filler that they needed. </p>
								<p>Now, who was going to beef up the Discord and help to shape this awesome website?
									None other than Mr Prosser. He is a Discord extraordinaire. He helped program almost
									every bot you see on the Discord today. He was also the leading force behind this
									website. Even though he is not an official Eulogist he is still a major part of our
									little world on YouTube</p>
								<p>The Goal of The Eulogists project is to teach and entertain. We want to teach you
									about music and how it affects us human beings and builds our world that we live in.
									We want to entertain you with our mashups and remixes to keep you coming back and
									keep you engaged. Even though we have a small channel we strive to have the highest
									quality content. On behalf of everyone at The Eulogists, Welcome to our world. </p>
